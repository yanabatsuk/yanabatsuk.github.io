I grew up in the bustling city of Seoul, South Korea, where my dreams of exploring the world first took root. Today, I am based in Charlotte, NC, but my heart still yearns to see new places and connect with incredible people like you.</p>

                    <h3 class="about-h3">Why Work With Me?</h3>
