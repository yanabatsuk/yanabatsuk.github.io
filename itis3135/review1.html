                <h3>CRAP Principles Evaluation</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Contrast:</strong> 
                        <ul>
                            <li>The site uses a distinct color scheme that makes content easy to read. Text contrasts well against the background, and headings stand out effectively.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>Repetition:</strong> 
                        <ul>
                            <li>There is good consistency in font styles and color usage across the pages. The buttons and headings match well, ensuring a unified design.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>Alignment:</strong> 
                        <ul>
                            <li>Text and images are neatly aligned. However, some elements on the gallery page feel slightly off-balance and could benefit from better spacing and alignment within a grid.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>Proximity:</strong> 
                        <ul>
                            <li>Related elements like headings and text are grouped well. However, on the contact page, the form elements could be more tightly packed with better spacing between inputs to give a cohesive look.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <h3>Contact Page Feedback</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        The contact page functions well but would benefit greatly from additional CSS styling. Suggestions include:
                        <ul>
                            <li>Add padding and margins to space out the form elements for a cleaner, professional appearance.</li>
                            <li>Consider using a border or a subtle background color for the form container to make it stand out from the rest of the page.</li>
                            <li>The hover effects on the buttons work well and enhance interactivity—these don't need changes.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <h3>Gallery Page Feedback</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>The gallery page could be styled more effectively:
                        <ul>
                            <li>Use a grid or flexbox layout to organize images neatly, ensuring equal spacing and alignment.</li>
                            <li>Consider adding hover effects on images to make the page more dynamic (e.g., zoom-in effect).</li>
                            <li>Add captions or alt text for better accessibility and user engagement.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <h3>Strengths</h3>
                <ul>

                    <li>Navigation is intuitive and user-friendly.</li>
                    <li>Good implementation of interactive features like hover effects on buttons.</li>
                </ul>
                <h3>Areas for Improvement</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Refine the spacing and alignment on the gallery page for a more polished appearance.</li>
                    <li>Add styling enhancements to the contact form to improve its visual appeal.</li>
                    <li>Ensure consistent alignment on all pages to maintain a professional look.</li>
